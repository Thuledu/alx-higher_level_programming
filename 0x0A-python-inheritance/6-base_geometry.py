class BaseGeometry:
    """
    A base class representing geometry.

    This class can be used as a base class for defining different geometric shapes and operations.

    Example:
        >>> class Rectangle(BaseGeometry):
        ...     def __init__(self, width, height):
        ...         self.width = width

        >>> rectangle.area()

        Calculate the area of the geometry.
